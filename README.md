Title: FaceBrute

Description:
VisageCrack is an elegant Python script crafted to showcase the seamless integration of the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries for web scraping and form submission. Its purpose is to exemplify the intricacies of logging into Facebook by employing a provided username (ideally an email) alongside a meticulously curated wordlist of passwords. Upon successful login, it graciously presents the triumphant entry message along with the password employed. Conversely, in the face of failure, it gracefully acknowledges the unsuccessful attempt.

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x installed
Internet connection for communication with Facebook
requests library installed (pip install requests)
beautifulsoup4 library installed (pip install beautifulsoup4)

How to Use:

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Install the required dependencies by executing:

git clone https://github.com/Bytebeem/FaceBrute.git

pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py

Proceed through the prompts:
Input the username (preferably an email) for the target Facebook account.
Specify the path to the meticulously crafted wordlist file containing passwords for the endeavor.
Relax and observe as the script valiantly endeavors to breach the login barrier. Upon success, it graciously presents the utilized password. In the event of failure, it acknowledges the valiant effort.
Note:

Ensure that you possess the requisite permissions to attempt login to the Facebook account.
Utilize this script judiciously, strictly adhering to educational or authorized testing purposes.
The success of brute-forcing hinges upon various factors, including password strength and any security measures meticulously implemented by Facebook.
